# Testing

Bonus item 4 of the brief: "write realistic tests". Realistic means tests that would have caught a real bug — not a suite that asserts a component renders.

## Layers

| Layer | Tool | Location | Runs against |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ------------ |
| Contract unit | vitest | `packages/contracts/src/*.test.ts` | Pure schemas |
| Service unit | vitest | `apps/api/src/services/*.test.ts` | Temp SQLite file |
| API integration | vitest + supertest | `apps/api/src/routes/*.test.ts` | Real Express app + temp SQLite |
| Component | vitest + RTL + MSW | `apps/web/src/**/*.test.tsx` | Mocked HTTP |
| E2E | Playwright | `e2e/*.spec.ts` | Both apps, real DB |

Weight sits on **API integration** — the endpoints where filtering, sorting, paging, validation, claims, and cascade all live. That is where the bugs are.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm test              # all workspaces
pnpm test:api
pnpm test:web
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright boots both apps via webServer (API :4010, web :5183)
pnpm test:e2e:report   # open the HTML report from the last run
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Database isolation

`DATABASE_URL` is set in **`apps/api/vitest.setup.ts`, registered as a `setupFiles` entry** — not in a `beforeAll`. `lib/prisma.ts` instantiates the client at *import* time, and test modules are imported before any hook runs, so a `beforeAll` assignment lands too late and the suite quietly runs against the developer's real database.

Each vitest worker gets its own file at `${os.tmpdir()}/helpdesk-test-${process.env.VITEST_WORKER_ID}.db`, and every one of them is removed at teardown. Per-worker rather than per-file, because vitest runs files in parallel across workers and a shared file would deadlock on SQLite's single writer. `beforeEach` truncates every table — `TaskEvent` included, which nothing cascades into.

The schema comes from `prisma migrate deploy`, run **once** in `globalSetup` against a template file (`helpdesk-test-template.db`) that each worker then copies. `globalSetup` has no way to know how many workers vitest will spawn, and the CLI costs ~0.6 s per invocation against a ~1 ms file copy — so the migration runs once and fans out by copying.

Non-negotiable: **tests never touch `apps/api/prisma/data/helpdesk.db`** and never use the seed. A developer losing local data to a test run is unacceptable, and a suite coupled to seed output breaks whenever the seed changes.

Fixtures are explicit builders — `makeTask({ status: "blocked", priority: "urgent" })`, `makeTask(claimedBy("agent:a"))`, `makeTaskAwaitingDecision()`, `makeDependency(a, b)` — so each test declares exactly the data its assertion depends on. They derive the rank columns through `applyTaskRanks()`; no test writes a rank number by hand.

## What must be covered

### Tasks ([../features/Tasks.md](../features/Tasks.md), [../features/Task_Workflow_API.md](../features/Task_Workflow_API.md))

- Create: happy path returns 201, `Location`, an integer `id`, its `reference`, defaults (`backlog` / `medium`, `version` 1), and `createdBy` = the `X-Actor`.
- Create: only `backlog` / `needs_refinement` / `todo` are accepted as the initial status; `todo` without `acceptanceCriteria` → 422 on that field.
- Create: **a repeated `idempotencyKey` returns 200 and the original task, unchanged, even with a different body** — and five concurrent creates with one key file exactly one task.
- Create: each validation failure → 422 with the field named in `details`; client-supplied `id` / `createdAt` / `createdBy` / `version` are rejected (`.strict()`); `project` is lowercased; `assignee` / `project` / `acceptanceCriteria` `""` are stored as `null`; a missing `parentId` → 422 on `parentId`.
- Get: 200 with comments oldest-first and `decisions` newest-first; unknown id → 404 `TASK_NOT_FOUND`; **non-numeric id (`/tasks/abc`) → 404, not 422 or 500**.
- Patch: partial update leaves untouched fields alone and bumps `version`; `{}` **and `{ expectedVersion }` alone** → 422 `AT_LEAST_ONE_FIELD`; `status` → 422 pointing at `/transition`; unknown id → 404.
- Patch: **a body that changes nothing performs no write** — no version bump, no `updatedAt` move, no event. A real change records `task.updated` with exactly the changed fields.
- Patch: stale `expectedVersion` → 409 `VERSION_CONFLICT` with `{ expected, current }`; another agent's live claim → 409 `TASK_ALREADY_CLAIMED`; a human is let through; a task cannot become its own ancestor.
- Patch: clearing `assignee` to `""` makes the task appear under `assigneeIsNull=true`.
- Delete: 204; comments, decisions, and dependency rows cascade; **the task's events survive**, plus `task.deleted`; twice → 404; blocked dependents waiting only on it are unblocked.
- Facets: distinct non-null `assignees`, `projects`, `creators`, sorted. Stats: all ten status keys, `needsAttention`, the `project` filter.

### List query ([../features/Task_Query_Filter_Sort_Page.md](../features/Task_Query_Filter_Sort_Page.md))

This section carries the most weight.

- Defaults: page 1, size 20, `createdAt:desc`.
- Paging: `meta.total` / `totalPages` / `hasNextPage` correct; page beyond the end → empty `data`, not 404; **no row appears on two pages and none is skipped**.
- `pageSize=0`, `pageSize=101`, `page=0` → 422. Empty values (`?page=&pageSize=`) fall back to defaults instead.
- Filters: single, repeated (OR within a param), and combined (AND across params) — `status`, `priority`, `project`, plus `createdBy`, `claimedBy` (matches an expired holder too), and `parentId` (digits only: `0x2a` → 422).
- `assigneeIsNull=true` returns only unassigned; sending it together with `assignee` → 422. A task assigned to someone literally named "None" is returned by `assignee=None` and **not** by `assigneeIsNull=true`.
- `q` matches title, matches description, and matches `TASK-000042`, `task-42`, `#42`, and bare `42`. **`q` combined with a status filter narrows, never widens.** `%`, `_`, and `!` are literals.
- Date range: `createdTo` set to a task's own creation date **includes** that task.
- **Sorting by priority puts `urgent` first; sorting by status follows lifecycle order** — the regression tests for the rank columns. A non-unique sort key across two pages keeps ids disjoint and covering (the `id` tiebreaker).
- Rows carry the summary fields computed from the right rows: `openDependencyCount` (a `deferred` blocker still counts), `openDecision` (only the open one), `claim` (`null` once the lease expired), `commentCount`.
- Unknown sort field / unknown query param → 422.

### Workflow ([../features/Task_Workflow_API.md](../features/Task_Workflow_API.md), [../features/Task_Status_Lifecycle.md](../features/Task_Status_Lifecycle.md))

- Transition: every target status succeeds with its payload, and **each missing requirement is a 422 on its field** (`reason`, `decision`, `instructions`, `summary`, …). `todo` passes on stored *or* supplied criteria and fails with neither. `statusNote` is replaced every time. `startedAt` is stamped only the first time; `completedAt` is set on `done` and cleared on reopening. Each transition records `task.status_changed`.
- Claims: entering `in_progress` claims for the caller, leaving it drops the claim; another agent is refused with `TASK_ALREADY_CLAIMED`; a human may override. **An expired lease serializes as `claim: null` and is claimable by anyone** — arranged by moving `claimExpiresAt` into the past in the database.
- Heartbeat: holder only (`NOT_CLAIM_HOLDER` otherwise), allowed on the holder's own expired lease, **no version bump**. Release: holder or human → `todo`; another agent → 409.
- Agents and `done`: 403 `ACTOR_NOT_PERMITTED` unless `AGENTS_MAY_COMPLETE` (toggled on `env` in the test and restored).
- `needs_qa` merges links, skipping known URLs. `blocked` + `blockedBy` adds dependencies; self / missing → 422 on `blockedBy`, a loop → 409 `DEPENDENCY_CYCLE`, and a failure rolls the whole transition back.
- `next`: priority, then oldest; skips `todo` tasks with unfinished (including `deferred`) dependencies; reclaims an expired `in_progress` task with a "Reclaimed from …" note; honours `project` / `minPriority`; `{ task: null }` when empty. **Many agents calling at once never receive the same task.** Two forced interleavings (a `findMany` spy): a heartbeat landing between the candidate read and the claim must not let `next` steal the task, and unrelated writes bumping every candidate's version must not make `next` answer `null`.
- Decisions: `→ needs_user_decision` creates one open decision and withdraws an older one; leaving another way withdraws it; answering with a choice and/or note moves the task to `todo` with the answer as `statusNote`; a choice that is not an option → 422 on `choice`; `NO_OPEN_DECISION` otherwise.
- Dependencies: add (no-op if present), remove (no-op if absent), self / missing → 422, cycle → 409 with the loop in `details.path`. **Auto-unblock** on `done`, on deleting a blocker, and on removing the last open dependency — only when *all* dependencies are `done`, attributed to `system:taskmanager`.

### Actors and the token gate

- No `X-Actor` → recorded as `human:anonymous`; mixed case is lowercased; malformed or `system:` → 422 with `details["X-Actor"]`, on reads too.
- With `API_TOKEN` set (assigned on `env` *before* `createApp()`): `/health` and `/docs` open, `/api/v1` 401 without the header, with a wrong token of the same or a different length (never a 500 — `timingSafeEqual` throws on unequal lengths), 200 with the right one; CORS preflights pass.

### Comments ([../features/Comments.md](../features/Comments.md))

- Add → 201, `author` = `X-Actor`, `kind` defaults to `note`, appears in the task's thread in order.
- **Add to a missing task → 404 `TASK_NOT_FOUND`, not 500.**
- Adding a comment does **not** change the task's `updatedAt` or `version` — except that the claim holder's comment renews its lease. Any actor may comment on a claimed task.
- Several comments created in the same millisecond come back in insertion order.
- Delete a comment belonging to a different task → 404, not 200 and not 403.
- Validation: empty body, over-length body, unknown `kind`.

### Events ([../features/Task_Workflow_API.md](../features/Task_Workflow_API.md) § Events)

- Oldest first; `after` returns only newer events; `taskId` filters; `limit` pages with `hasMore`; `nextAfter` is the last id, or the incoming cursor echoed back when nothing is new.
- `order=desc` pages backwards with `before` (smallest id on the page, `null` once empty); `from`/`to` narrow to an instant range independent of `order`; `order=asc` with none of them sent is byte-identical to the original behaviour.
- `taskTitle` is joined at read time from the task's current row (one query per page) and is `null` once the task is deleted, independent of the `project` snapshot stamped on the event itself.
- **Events survive the task's deletion.** Real writes land in the feed with the right actor and payload.
- Bad cursor / `taskId` / `limit`, or an unknown param → 422; empty values are absent.

### Floor snapshot ([../features/Floor_Snapshot.md](../features/Floor_Snapshot.md))

- Scope (`project`) removes rows; every other filter marks `matches` instead — nothing moves.
- Cap ordering (must-show, then priority, then recency), `meta.truncated`, and `meta.statusCounts` counting everything regardless of the cap or the shipped window.
- `openBlockerCount`/`unblocksCount` computed once per node from the full `TaskDependency` table, unaffected by the floor's own scope.
- Replay (`?at=`): status/existence rebuilt from `task.status_changed`/`task.created` events; a task created after `at` is absent; a deleted task is absent even if it existed at `at`.

### History stats ([../features/History_Stats.md](../features/History_Stats.md))

- Bucket alignment to UTC boundaries; a range over `HISTORY_MAX_BUCKETS` → 422.
- `statusCounts` is a full replay from the start of the event log, not just the requested window.
- `cycleTimes`/`longestWaits` caps, and an open (`endedAt: null`) wait measured against now, not the range's `to`.
- Per-agent `submitted`/`approved`/`sentBack` counts attribute a `needs_qa` outcome to the actor who made the closing transition, not the one who submitted it.

### Concurrency ([DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md) § Concurrent writes)

- Twenty concurrent creates, twenty list reads during writes, and interleaved `next` / comments / patches all succeed — **no 500s**. The write queue keeps working after a rejected transaction.

### Errors ([API_ERROR_CONTRACT.md](./API_ERROR_CONTRACT.md))

- Every error response has `code`, `message`, `requestId`.
- A forced internal error returns a generic message with **no stack trace**.
- Unknown route → 404 `NOT_FOUND`.
- **Malformed JSON body → 400 `MALFORMED_JSON`** (not 500).
- **Body over `BODY_LIMIT` → 413 `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`** (not 500).
- Every code in the contract table has a test that produces it (`routes/error-codes.test.ts`) — that is the check that keeps unreachable codes out of the table.

### Web components

- `TaskFilterBar`: changing a filter updates the URL and resets `page` to 1.
- `useTaskListParams`: garbage params fall back to defaults without throwing.
- `TaskForm`: shows field errors, maps a server `VALIDATION_ERROR` onto fields, and **keeps values after a failed submit**.
- `TransitionDialog`: renders the right fields for each target status, a blank required field is reported with UI copy (not the contract's generic message), and a server rejection re-splits onto fields vs. the summary.
- `StatusSelect`: reports the picked value without firing on Radix's initial mount sync; renders a status change's error message inline.
- List page: renders loading skeleton → rows; renders the correct empty variant for "no tasks" vs "no matches"; error panel retry refetches.
- Task detail page: inline status change is optimistic and rolls back on failure; claim panel renders Release / Claim only when a live claim or an unclaimed `in_progress` task calls for it; delete confirms first.
- Edit page: only changed fields are sent (`diffTaskPatch`); a `VERSION_CONFLICT` shows the reload notice without discarding typed values.
- Inbox page: groups by status in lifecycle order; a decision, action, and QA item each expose their own clearing controls without navigating away.
- `ConfirmDialog`: cancel does not fire the mutation.

There is no client-side transition table to assert against — any status may move to any other — so the `TransitionDialog`/`StatusSelect` tests above are about the payload a target needs, not about which moves are "allowed".

MSW intercepts at the network layer so the real query hooks and fetch client are exercised — mocking the hooks would test the mock.

### E2E (user-level flows)

**Data strategy.** `e2e/prepareDatabase.ts` deletes `e2e/helpdesk-e2e.db`, runs `migrate deploy` against it, and seeds it with `ALLOW_SEED=true` — the suite needs enough rows for filtering and paging to be meaningful, which is the one place seed data is legitimate. It is a **third** database: not the dev file, not the vitest temp files.

**The database is built by the API's `webServer` command, not by `globalSetup`.** Playwright starts the web servers *before* `globalSetup`, and the API opens its SQLite file at boot (`enableWal()` in `server.ts`, which also creates an empty file if none exists). So the command is `tsx e2e/prepareDatabase.ts && tsx src/server.ts`: the file exists before the process does. Replacing it afterwards — which is what `globalSetup` used to do, back when the API touched no database until the first request — leaves the server on an unlinked inode and every request answers `The table main.Task does not exist`. `globalSetup` now only asks the *API* for a task count, so a regression fails at setup with a sentence naming the cause.

Because the suite shares one database across specs, **every test that mutates creates its own task first and acts on that one.** No spec may delete or edit a seeded task, or the run becomes order-dependent and fails only in CI. Every run starts from an empty file, so a crashed run never poisons the next one.

**The agent is played over HTTP.** Half of this product is agents driving tasks, so several specs are hand-offs: the helpers in `e2e/helpers.ts` call the API as `X-Actor: agent:e2e-bot` (create, `POST /tasks/next`, claim, transition, PATCH) and the browser plays the human. A task an agent takes with `next` is filed in a project of its own (`uniqueProject()`), so `next` can only hand out that task and never a seeded `todo` row. Specs assert what the **server** recorded (`getTask`, `GET /events?taskId=`) as well as what the page shows — attribution in particular is only provable from the server's side.

| Spec | File |
| ---- | ---- |
| Create a task through the form (project, acceptance criteria, starting in To do — first without criteria, which is refused with nothing lost) → detail page with its `TASK-` reference → top of the list → filter by its project, which survives a reload | `e2e/create-task.spec.ts` |
| "Open work" preset, sort by priority, page forward — URL reflects each step and survives reload; priorities non-increasing across the page boundary | `e2e/filter-sort-page.spec.ts` |
| Detail: → Blocked and → Deferred through `TransitionDialog` (Deferred submitted empty first), a `progress` comment, the activity timeline in order; all persisted across a reload and matched against the event feed | `e2e/task-detail-workflow.spec.ts` |
| Agent files a task, takes it with `next`, asks a decision → inbox shows it and the header badge equals `stats.needsAttention` → human picks a (non-recommended) option with a note → task leaves the inbox, badge drops by one, detail shows To do, "Decision: …" note, and the past decision | `e2e/inbox-decision.spec.ts` |
| Agent hands work to QA with a summary and PR link → human sends it back from the inbox (→ To do + `qa_feedback` comment) → agent re-submits (link de-duplicated) → human approves (→ Done) | `e2e/qa-handoff.spec.ts` |
| The retired Kanban board's route redirects to the map, keeping the query string | `e2e/board-redirect.spec.ts` |
| Delete behind the confirm dialog (which names the comment it cascades to; cancel first) → gone from the list, a search, and the API — its events survive | `e2e/delete-task.spec.ts` |
| The list at 360px renders cards, not a table, and nothing scrolls sideways | `e2e/mobile-list.spec.ts` |
| "You": set a name → comments and transitions are recorded as `human:<slug>` (checked via the API), and the name survives a reload | `e2e/session-actor.spec.ts` |
| Edit form open, agent PATCHes the task → human's save is refused with the version-conflict notice, typed values kept → reload → save carries the agent's change forward | `e2e/edit-conflict.spec.ts` |

**Its own ports, and `reuseExistingServer: false`.** The API runs on `4010` and the web app on `5183`, never `4000`/`5173`. On the development ports, `reuseExistingServer` would hand the suite a developer's `pnpm dev` servers — pointed at `apps/api/prisma/data/helpdesk.db` — and the specs create, transition, and *delete* tasks. That is the same rule as § Database isolation above, applied to the E2E layer: a test run must not be able to touch local data. A busy port is therefore an error rather than a substitution. Everything is spelled `127.0.0.1` and never `localhost`, and Vite is started with `--host 127.0.0.1`: told `localhost`, it binds whichever loopback the resolver prefers, which on some machines is `::1` only — and the run then fails as a bare "Timed out waiting 60000ms from config.webServer".

**One worker, no retries.** The suite shares one SQLite database. The create spec asserts a just-created task is at the *top* of a list sorted newest-first, and the inbox spec compares the header badge with `GET /tasks/stats` — both global facts a second worker would race. Retries are off, in CI too: an intermittent failure that a retry turns green is exactly the signal the suite exists to produce.

**Reading the rendered list is always polled.** The list page keeps the previous rows on screen while the next query is in flight, so a single read straight after a click races the refetch. Use `expect.poll` (or a settle signal rendered from the same data, such as the pager's "Showing 21–…") rather than `allInnerTexts()` once. Likewise, while a modal is open the page behind it is `aria-hidden`, so "nothing changed yet" is asserted against the API, not the obscured control. Pages that poll (inbox, detail, badge; 15 s) are **reloaded** after an out-of-band agent write rather than waited on.

**Browsers.** `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` once per machine (CI does it with `--with-deps`). The config defines exactly one project, `chromium`.

## Conventions

- Test names state the behavior: `"returns 409 when closing a task is followed by setting it back to resolved"`, not `"test status"`.
- One assertion subject per test; multiple `expect`s about that subject are fine.
- No `waitFor(() => {})` polling where a proper `findBy*` query works.
- No snapshot tests of whole components — they fail on every copy change and get regenerated without reading.
- CI runs `typecheck` → `lint` → `test` → `test:e2e`.
